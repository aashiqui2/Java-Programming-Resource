God created earth.
(class)     (object)
before the object we can have method(Activity).

class Calculator
{
    psv main(s[] args){

    }
}
human name is doesn't belongs to object it is for class.


class Customer{
    psv main(String[] args){
        Customer anbu=new Customer("anbu","1/1/2001",1234);//memory reference//object//instance specific details
        Customer selvam=new Customer("1234,1234);
        anbu.applyloan();
