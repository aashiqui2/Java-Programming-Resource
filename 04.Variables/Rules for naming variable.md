# Rules for Naming Variable:
* A variable name cannot start with a number.
It must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z), underscore (_) or dollar sign ($).

* Variable names cannot be Java reserved words (e.g., int, class, static, public, etc.).

* Java is case-sensitive, so Age, age, and AGE are different variables.

* Variable names cannot contain spaces.

* Only letters, digits, _, and $ are allowed.
Special characters (@, #, %, !, &, etc.) are NOT allowed.

* Use meaningful names (firstName, maxScore) instead of a, b, x1.
Use camelCase (first letter lowercase, next words capitalized).

* No strict length limit, but keep it meaningful and readable.
