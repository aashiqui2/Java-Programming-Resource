Precedence of operator come into picture when in on expression we need to decide which operator will be decided to evaluated first.Operator with higher precedence will be evaluated first.

2+3*5

Associativity of operator come into picture  when precence of operator are same and we need to decide which operator will be evaluated first.

its can be either 
left to right
right  to left

10/2* 5

(10/2)*5
10/(2*5)

Certainly! Here's a table outlining the operator precedence and associativity for all operators in Python:

| Operator       | Description                                       | Associativity |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `()`           | Parentheses (grouping)                            | Left to right |
| `f(args...)`   | Function call                                     | Left to right |
| `x[index:index]`, `x[index]` | Subscription, slicing                      | Left to right |
| `x.attribute`  | Attribute reference                               | Left to right |
| `**`           | Exponentiation                                    | Right to left |
| `+x`, `-x`, `~x` | Positive, negative, bitwise NOT                | Right to left |
| `*`, `/`, `//`, `%` | Multiplication, division, floor division, modulo | Left to right |
| `+`, `-`       | Addition, subtraction                            | Left to right |
| `<<`, `>>`     | Bitwise shifts                                    | Left to right |
| `&`            | Bitwise AND                                      | Left to right |
| `^`            | Bitwise XOR                                      | Left to right |
| `\|`           | Bitwise OR                                       | Left to right |
| `in`, `not in`, `is`, `is not`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`, `==` | Comparisons | Left to right |
| `not`          | Boolean NOT                                       | Right to left |
| `and`          | Boolean AND                                       | Left to right |
| `or`           | Boolean OR                                        | Left to right |
| `if else`      | Conditional expression                           | Left to right |
| `:=`           | Assignment expression (walrus operator)           | Right to left |



Postfix /Prefix(++,--)

Precedence of postfix increment/Decrement operator is greater than prefix increment/Decrement

Associativity of Postfix is also different from prefix,Associativity of postfix operator is from left to right and that of prefix operators is from right to left.
